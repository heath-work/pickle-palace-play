# Intro to Pickleball

Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the world, combining elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. Played with a paddle and a plastic ball with holes, it's accessible to all ages and skill levels.

## Basic Rules

The game is played on a court similar to a tennis court but smaller. Players serve underhand cross-court, and there's a 7-foot non-volley zone called "the kitchen" near the net where players cannot volley the ball.

## Equipment

To get started, you'll need:
- A pickleball paddle
- Pickleballs
- Comfortable athletic shoes
- Athletic clothing

## Why It's Popular

Pickleball's growing popularity stems from its accessibility, social nature, and the perfect balance of competitive play without requiring the same physicality as tennis.
